# KeypadMapper
A custom Rainmeter skin to keep track of functions mapped to an external keypad peripheral. Currently the skin is only set up for a Razer Tartarus and is customizable in terms of color and button label, including images, but there are plans to add functionality for a gui to edit the layout for different keypads, use it as a virtual keypad, and even remap your keypad bindings with the skin.

NOTE: rainmeter DOES NOT like dashes in file paths
