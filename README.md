# KeypadMapper
A custom Rainmeter skin to keep track of functions mapped to an external keypad peripheral. Currently the skin is customizable in terms of color and button label, including images, but there are plans to add functionality for a gui to edit the layout for different keypads, use it as a virtual keypad, and even remap your keypad with the skin.

Based upon "MacroMap" by AhmetAkyuez

NOTE: rainmeter DOES NOT like dashes in file paths
